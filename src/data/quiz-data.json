      "question": "Why is the hydrogen atom on a terminal alkyne (R-C≡C-H) weakly acidic?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because the C-H bond is non-polar.",
        "B": "Because the resulting carbanion is sp³ hybridized and unstable.",
        "C": "Because the carbon is sp hybridized (50% s-character), making it more electronegative and able to stabilize the negative charge.",
        "D": "Because it readily forms a stable carbocation upon losing a proton."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The acidity of terminal alkynes (Section 1.2) is due to the high s-character (50%) of the sp-hybridized carbon. This makes the carbon atom more electronegative, which helps to stabilize the negative charge on the resulting acetylide anion."

      "options": {
        "A": "It is a planar ring of six sp² hybridized carbon atoms.",
        "B": "It has a delocalized π-electron cloud above and below the ring.",
        "C": "All C-C bond lengths are identical.",
        "D": "It readily undergoes addition reactions to break the delocalized system."
      },
      "answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Benzene's exceptional stability, due to its delocalized aromatic system, causes it to undergo substitution (EAS) instead of addition, as this preserves the stable aromatic ring (Section 1.3.2)."

        "A": "The phenyl cation is very stable.",
        "B": "The C-X bond is non-polar.",
        "C": "The C-X bond has partial double bond character due to resonance with the ring.",
        "D": "The benzene ring sterically hinders the nucleophile."
      },
      "answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Section 2.2 provides the reason for the low reactivity of aryl halides: resonance of the halogen's lone pairs with the benzene ring gives the C-X bond partial double bond character, making it stronger and harder to break."
